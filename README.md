Dose Response
=============

Dose Response is an open-world roguelike where you play an addict.
Avoid the dangers threatening your mind and body while desperately
looking for the next fix.

How To Play
-----------

You control the `@` character on the screen. You can move in the four
**cardinal directions** (up, down, left and right) and four **diagonal
directions** (north-east, south-east, north-west, south-west).

For the in-game help click on the `Help` button or press `?` (question
mark) while playing.

Whenever you see a `%` it's a food that you can pick up and use later.
If you move onto it, you pick it up automatically.

`i` is a dose and your character uses it as soon as you step on it. It
destroys nearby monsters and expands your field of view.

When your come down from the effect of the dose, you'll go into a
withdrawal. Eventually, you'll lose of exhaustion.

You can eat food (or find another dose) to stave off the effects.

When you have an item you can use (such as food) it will appear in
your inventory in the sidebar next to a numeric key. You use it by
pressing the key.


Remember:
* At the beginning, you can overdose very easily
* Doses differ in purity, sometimes you come across a weak one and
  other times it's the bomb
* You build up tolerance so you'll eventually have to consume more and
  more doses or move onto the stronger stuff
* It is possible to win the game

## Controls

The game is controlled by keyboard. There are three keyboard schemes
you can use:

### Numpad (recommended)

Most desktop computers have a numpad, but a lot of laptops don't. If
you have it, you can use its keys to move around:

Use `8`, `2`, `4` and `6` keys to move up/down/left/right.

To move diagonally, use `7`, `9`, `1` and `3` to move north-west,
north-east, south-west and south-east.

### Arrows keys + `ctrl`/`shift`

Use your `up`, `down`, `left` and `right` keys to move
up/down/left/right.

To move diagonally, pressing `control` and `left`/`right` means "north"
and pressing `shift` means "south".

So to move north-east you hold `control` and press `right`. To go
south-west you hold `shift` and press `left`.

### Vi-keys

Use `k`, `j`, `h` and `l` to move up/down/left/right.

To move diagonally, press `y`, `b`, `u` and `n` to move north-west,
south-west, north-east and south-west.
